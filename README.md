How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this 
CRUD Python module in the future?

To make my programs maintainable and adaptable, I always make sure that my code is modular. Modular programming makes it much easier to make changes to a program, as each
function is contained within its own individual module. Making code readable involves using proper syntax and spacing, along with making use of plenty of 
comments to denote what specific lines of code do. One of the main advantages of working this way is that it is very easy to reuse modular code for multiple projects, 
which is what I did when working on the Grazioso Salvare project with my CRUD module.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create
databases to meet other client requests?

This question appears to be a little fleeting. As a computer scientist, I take a piecemeal approach to problem resolution. I consider what tools I'll need to complete 
a task and begin there. Documenting the list of tools, you'll need to tackle an issue and then building upon it until you reach completion strikes me as excellent work. 
In addition, I believe it is critical to address issues one at a time. For this project, I concentrated on completing each need in order, then improving them after 
I had the functionality I desired. One of the advantages of jupyter notebooks is that you can separate your code frame and test it as you go. I did this a lot to make 
sure I got the results I desired by running and rerunning statements. I must have run the dashboard 300 times and double-checked each criterion. Then I'd move on after 
the condition had been met. I started experiencing issues with the virtual lab near the conclusion of the assignment. I would have spent more time evaluating 
and cleaning if I hadn't done so.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Once again, this is a rather fleeting question. On computers, computer scientists create tools, widgets, and apps. Some people specialize in data science and create 
reports, like how a full stack developer would handle, evaluate, and display data. Some people specialize in systems, such as database administrators and system 
administrators, and their job entails setting and enabling systems to communicate with one another. Finally, there are software developers who construct apps from the 
ground up, such as app developers, programmers, testers, and other software developers. This work reminds me a lot of data science work. Graziano will benefit from 
having a dashboard to use while looking for and locating service animals. It is a low-maintenance tool with certain capabilities for them to work with because it is 
immediately related to the data. It's also modular and interactive, offering people the ability to collaborate with the product because it was created in Dash. Dash 
was a fantastic tool for this project, and it's one I'd want to bring to work with me. I'd want to show off its capabilities and create tools that are adaptable for the 
team. I believe that the reporting paradigm in which a customer approaches a programmer and requests a report within a certain period with fixed specifications is 
giving way to more rapid prototyping and development. As a result, most data scientists are not programmers, but rather persons with a PhD degree in stem education.
